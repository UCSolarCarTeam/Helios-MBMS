	// the input is going to be a message saying which contactor to close
	// every corresponding precharger and contactor have the same number (i.e motor precharger and contactor are both 2)
	// This function will take in the contactor of interest for the precharger and also either 1 or 0
	// 1 = close the contactor
	// 0 = open the contactor
	PreChargerContactor(arg, 1);

	// Now I think there should some delay before the contactor's closed
	delay();

	// secondly, it must close the array the gatekeeper wanted closed (this is so the contactor isn't flooded with high voltage)
	GatekeeperContactor(arg, 1);



	// thirdly, once the array is closed and a 'transition voltage' is provided by the precharger, the precharger opens and the state of the contactor is changed from 'closing' to 'closed'
	// this means that there won't be a voltage spike now so thats safer ðŸ˜Œ
	PreChargerContactor(arg, 0);

	// check the voltage by reading the line and making sure it's what we want (the battery voltage)
	// if it is, we can change the state from 'closing' to 'closed'
